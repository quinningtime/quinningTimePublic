README

This is a jamf pro worflow designed to pull inventory record information from jamf pro into a script.

Components Involved:
1. A configuration profile with the custom payload with a plist file containing configuration profile payload variables 
as documented here: https://docs.jamf.com/10.23.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Computer_Configuration_Profiles.html
2. Bash Script code that reads the managed preference plist pushed by the configuration profile that can be put into another script 
that then does something with that information. No doubt something could be written in Python or other languages but I chose bash.
