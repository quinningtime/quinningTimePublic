############# About this Program ###########
##Written by quinningtime using some code originally found a script written by rtrouton. Original script can be found here: https://github.com/quinningtime/rtrouton_scripts/tree/master/rtrouton_scripts/detect_user-approved_mdm


########### Description ##############
# This script will evalute if the installed jamf pro MDM profile is user approved, if the MDM status comes back as not user approved it then uses jamf helper to generate a pop-up message to prompt the user to approve the MDM profile. The Pop up message will give the user the choice to approve the MDM later or right away. If they choose to proceed with approveding the MDM profile the Self Service Store will be launched to display instructions for how to approve the MDM profile. This function relies on enabling the "Enable User Approved MDM Profile Notification" option on in the macOS Self Service settings on Jamf Pro.  If the MDM has already been approved then a jamf recon is run to update inventory.
